# advent-of-code

This is my implementation of the solutions to advent-of-code, which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

Each solution uses `axios` to get the input value, using a `SESSION` environment variable to store my personalized `Cookie`. To get this to work for you, make an account and paste your own personal `Cookie` in a `.env` file. You can find your `Cookie` by looking in the header in the network tab when you go to an `input` endpoint such as `https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/input`.
